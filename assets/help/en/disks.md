# Disks

To inspect and prepare disks and USB sticks, like macOS Disk Utility or GNOME Disks.

## View

- Internal disks, external disks and images, with their partitions, how full they are and where
  they are mounted.
- **Health (SMART):** “Check health” reads what the disk reports: status, temperature, power-on
  hours, reallocated or pending sectors and, on NVMe, the life used. Virtual disks and many cards
  report nothing.

## Do

- **Mount**, **unmount** and **eject** a USB stick before pulling it out.
- **Format** a USB stick or partition as **FAT32** (works everywhere, files up to 4 GB), **exFAT**
  (large sticks, without that limit), **ext4** (Linux) or **NTFS** (Windows, if its tool is
  installed).
- **Rename** the volume (unmounted).
- **Erase:** quick (the table and signatures) or writing zeros everywhere.
- **Create a bootable USB** from an `.iso` or `.img` image: it is copied as is and then
  **verified** by reading the disk back.

## Safety

Before erasing anything, a dialog shows exactly what will be lost (disk, partitions, where they
are mounted and how much data they hold) and you have to type the disk's name. **The system disk
cannot be formatted, erased or unmounted** from here. Internal disks can only be changed by an
administrator; USB sticks by any user.
