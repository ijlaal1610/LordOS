# Design guide for LordOS apps

LordOS apps follow our design guide, modeled on widely used desktop human-interface conventions: generous whitespace, a small type scale,
consistent control heights and one accent-colored action per view. This guide is the reference
for every polish pass, so all apps share the same spacing, type and controls. The shared building
blocks are in `sdk/controls.jsx` and `sdk/components.jsx`, and the tokens below are exported from
the SDK as `spacing`, `typeScale` and `controlSize`.

The first pass (Calculator, Text Editor, Notes, Photos, PDF Viewer and Fonts) and the second one
(Terminal, Store, Monitor, Player, Screenshots, Camera, Voice Recorder, Scanner, Emoji & Symbols
with the system emoji picker, About and the Installer) are documented with before/after
screenshots in [`docs/polish/`](polish/), as is the third (Settings page by page, Files, Terminal
Preferences and the Store's remaining pages), and the fourth (the system apps: Disks, Backups, Logs,
Clock and Help), as is the fifth (Mail, Calendar, Contacts and Reminders) and the last one (Passwords).

## Spacing: an 8 px grid

| Token | px | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `xs` | 4 | tight spots: between a glyph and its label, between grouped toolbar buttons |
| `s` | 8 | between controls in a row, between rows of a list, toolbar gap |
| `m` | 12 | toolbar side insets, inside a grouped box, between a label and its control |
| `l` | 16 | padding of panels and dialogs that sit inside a window |
| `xl` | 20 | **window content inset** (nothing touches the window edge), dialog padding |
| `xxl` | 24 | between groups and sections |

Rules:

- The content of a window starts 20 px from its edges. Lists in a sidebar start 10 px in, with
  8–10 px of padding inside each row.
- Separate groups by 20–24 px and controls by 8–12 px. Never place two controls touching.
- Use hairlines (1 px, `separator`) between a sidebar and its content, under a toolbar and above a
  status bar. Don't use thick borders.

## Type scale

Inter, weights 400 / 500 / 600 only (700 only for very short emphasis).

| Token | px | Weight | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `caption` | 11 | 400–600 | secondary labels, section captions in sidebars, status bars, counts |
| `callout` | 12 | 400 | hints, secondary text in rows |
| `body` | 13 | 400–500 | default text, list rows, buttons, menus |
| `headline` | 15 | 600 | dialog titles, month headers, empty-state titles |
| `title` | 17 | 600 | the title of a pane when space is short |
| `largeTitle` | 22 | 600 | the title of a library or detail view (Photos, Fonts) |

Secondary text uses `textDim`. Avoid uppercase captions: use sentence case ("Contents",
not "CONTENTS").

## Controls

| Control | Height | Radius | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Button` | 28 (regular), 22 (`small`) | 7 / 6 | `primary` = the one accent action of the view; `plain` = borderless; `destructive` |
| `TextInput` | 28 (13 px text) | 7 | grows with `size` |
| `SearchField` | 28 | 7 | magnifier at the leading edge, clear button at the trailing edge |
| `Segmented` | 28 (22 `small`) | 8 | `appearance="neutral"` for view switchers (Read/Edit, Sample/Characters/Info); `fill` to share the width |
| `ToolbarButton` | 28 (22 `small`) | 6 | icon-only items **must** have a `title` (tooltip); `active` = toggled on |
| `ToolbarGroup` | 32 | 8 | buttons that belong together: zoom −/value/+, markup tools |
| `Toolbar` | 44 | — | 12 px side insets, 8 px gap, hairline at the bottom |
| `SidebarItem` | 28 | 6 | source list row; string `icon` is drawn in the accent color; optional `detail` |
| `MenuButton` | 28 | 8 | "⋯" or "⊕" button that opens a small menu (checked, disabled and destructive items) |
| `Toggle` | 24 (20 `small`) | — | `small` = the 36 × 20 switch of grouped forms (Settings rows) |
| `Hairline` | 1 | — | `edge="top" \| "bottom" \| "start" \| "end"`: a 1 px separator on that edge of its parent; start/end follow RTL |

Icons are monochrome Unicode glyphs from the fallback fonts (Inter, DejaVu Sans, Noto Sans
Symbols 1/2), not color emoji. Verified on the VM:
`✎ ⧉ ⊕ ⋯ ◫ ⛶ ⤢ ⟲ ⟳ ↻ ⎙ ⌕ ✕ ◐ ▬ ▤ ▦ ▶ ⓘ ☺ ‹ ›`. Color emoji (🗑 📎 🖼 🗨) and some
symbols (🗀) don't render as icons: draw a small shape instead (see `FolderGlyph` in Photos).
The media symbols (⏮ ⏸ ⏭ 🔁 🔊 💬 🎙 📷) are color emoji too: the Player draws its transport
glyphs (`PlayGlyph`, `PauseGlyph`, `SkipGlyph`, `SpeakerGlyph`, `CaptionsGlyph`), the Camera and
the Recorder draw their empty-state icons. `↻ ⤮ ♪ ◫ ▣ ☺ ≡` render monochrome.

## Layout patterns

- **Sidebar (source list):** 200–240 px, `sidebarBg`, a hairline on its trailing edge,
  `SectionTitle` captions (11 px, 600, `textDim`) and `SidebarItem` rows. A search field goes at
  the top of the sidebar when the list is what you search.
- **Toolbar:** icon-only buttons with tooltips where that is the convention. Show a text label only for
  the main mode switch or the back button. Push trailing items to the end with `ToolbarSpacer`. In
  narrow windows, hide items that are also in the app menus (print, invert, rotate), and move
  secondary actions into a `MenuButton` ("⋯"), so the toolbar never wraps to a second row.
- **Grouped form ("inset"):** `GroupBox` with `FormRow` children: a rounded box (radius 10) with
  hairlines between rows. Rows are at least 32–36 px. In a key/value list, put the labels in a
  right-aligned column (`labelWidth`) and the values leading-aligned.
- **Empty state:** `EmptyState` with an icon, a short title (15/600) and one hint line (12,
  `textDim`), centered. At most one primary button.
  For an outcome worth a little warmth (an error or an unavailable service, "everything is up to
  date") pass `mascot` instead of the icon: `mascot="confused"`, `"celebrate"`, `"shield"` or
  `"wave"` draws Lumo at 112 px (`sdk/mascot.js`, docs/LORDOS-BRAND.md). Not in "nothing selected"
  panes, and never more than one Lumo per view.
- **Dialogs and sheets:** 20 px padding, title 15/600, body 13 with `lineHeight: 1.4`, buttons at
  the end of the last row with 12 px above them. The default action is `primary`.
- **Hierarchy:** one primary (accent) action per view. Everything else is plain or neutral.
- **Inspector / detail pane:** a fixed-width pane (200–280 px, `sidebarBg`, `Hairline edge="start"`)
  shows an `EmptyState` until something is selected, never a blank column (Emoji & Symbols).
- **Media bar:** the Player's now-playing bar spans the whole window: cover and title at the
  start, the transport (buttons above a progress row) in a 380 px center column, the volume at
  the end. Under 720 px it keeps only the cover and the transport. Measure the box after layout
  (`lord.getLayout(ref.current.id)[2]`) to adapt columns and widths (Player, Recorder waveform).
- **Viewfinder apps (Camera):** always dark, whatever the theme; mode switch as two words with
  the current one in yellow, a 60 px shutter centered between two `flex: 1` columns.
- **Wizards (Installer):** step list in the sidebar (numbered circles, the current row
  highlighted), `largeTitle` step title, fields with 16 px between them, a footer with a hairline
  and Back / Next (`disabled` instead of a faded look).
- **Utility (Disks):** the actions for the selection are labelled `ToolbarButton`s over the detail
  pane (the ones that don't fit go into "⋯"), the details are a `GroupBox` of `FormRow`s with a
  right-aligned label column, and the selection title is `largeTitle`.
- **Console (Logs):** one 44 px toolbar (live, export, process field, `SearchField`), a 40 px scope bar
  with small neutral `Segmented` filters, column captions over the list, a detail pane and a status
  bar, each separated by a `Hairline`.
- **Settings plus browser (Backups):** a header with the app icon, status and the one primary action;
  a neutral `Segmented` centered in a 44 px bar; settings as `GroupBox`es in a 640 px centered
  column; the browser as a dated source list plus a file list with column captions.
- **Tabbed utility (Clock):** the tabs in the toolbar, centered, and the "add" action as a "+"
  toolbar button at the trailing edge, never a button floating at the bottom.
- **Reader (Help):** a centered reading column up to 680 px; the article keeps its own direction
  (`textDirection(body)`), so an English article in an Arabic interface still reads left to right.
- **Mail / Calendar / Contacts / Reminders:** source lists use monochrome glyphs in the accent
  color; where the glyph would be a color emoji (tray, archive, trash, folder, person) it is drawn
  with views (`Glyph` in `apps/mail`, `PersonGlyph` in `apps/contacts`). Mail keeps three panes with
  an icon-only toolbar over the list and the message; list rows are 86 px (sender, subject, two lines
  of preview) with a rounded selection, and under 1000 px the panes shrink to 200 / 290 px.
  Calendar centers the Day/Week/Month switch, puts the period title (22/700) over the grid with
  ‹ Today › at its trailing edge, and hides the sidebar below 760 px unless asked for. Bottom bars
  of adjacent columns share one height (40 px) so their hairlines line up. Text that belongs to the
  user (event titles, previews) keeps its own direction (`textDirection`) in an RTL UI.
  `ToolbarButton`'s `icon` may also be an element (a drawn glyph).
- **Settings (System Settings):** a 220 px sidebar (search field, the user card, groups of
  `SidebarItem` rows 12 px apart with 20 px colored badges: a soft vertical gradient and a white
  glyph, or a drawn shape where the glyph is a color emoji), a 48 px title bar over the page with a
  hairline, and the page in a scroll view (20 px from the top, 24 px side insets, at most 680 px wide,
  centered). Pages are built only from `apps/settings/ui.jsx`: `Stack` (sections 20 px apart),
  `Section` (13/600 header, an inset `GroupBox`, an 11 px footer), `SettingRow` (28 px of content
  with 4 px above and below, so 36 px between hairlines; the control at the trailing edge),
  `ValueRow` (value right-aligned in `textDim`), `FieldRow` (a field of a fixed width at the trailing
  edge), `Actions` (buttons under a group, trailing), `Note`/`Message`. Buttons inside rows are
  `small` (22 px); switches are `<Toggle small>` (36 × 20). Pickers between a few pictures (light/dark,
  Dock side) are thumbnail tiles with a 2 px accent ring.
- **Passwords (an isolated app):** a 220 px source list (`SearchField`, then accent glyph rows,
  `SectionTitle` captions, category rows with 18 px colored tiles and tag rows with a color dot; a 41 px
  bottom bar with the generator, settings and Lock), a 290 px item list (17/600 title, 48 px rows with a
  30 px tile, sort and "+" as toolbar buttons) and the detail pane (22/600 title, chips, the fields in
  an inset group with icon-only copy/show buttons, small secondary buttons, destructive ones in red).
  Under 960 px the columns shrink to 200 / 250 px and the detail title to 17 px. Category glyphs are
  drawn (`apps/passwords/glyphs.jsx`); a category stores the glyph's name, and old emoji values map to
  the nearest glyph. The lock screens are a 360–460 px centered column with a 22/600 title and a neutral
  method switch; sheets are 48 px title + 20 px padding and scroll when the window is too small. An
  isolated app gets the UI direction with the language (`locale.dir`), so it mirrors in RTL too.
- **Preferences panes (Terminal):** sections as sidebar rows (not a long tab bar that cannot fit),
  a header with the section and profile names and the `Done` button, and a form with a 170 px
  right-aligned label column. Measure the pane: under 480 px the labels go above their controls.
  Lists of editable items (key mappings, triggers, shortcuts) are inset `GroupBox` rows.

## Robustness checklist

Check every pass on the VM with:

- **light and dark** mode;
- **RTL** (Arabic test pack `docs/packs/lordos-lang-ar.json`). The engine mirrors rows. Content
  that is itself left to right keeps `direction: 'ltr'` (calculator keypad, code, sliders, page
  geometry), and user text follows its own direction with `textDirection(text)` (a Spanish note in
  an Arabic UI still reads left to right);
- the **minimum window size** (`minSize` in the manifest) and a **large/maximized** window;
- no overlapping or clipped controls, and no toolbar that wraps. Text that can be long uses
  `whiteSpace: 'nowrap'` and `textOverflow: 'ellipsis'` inside a `flex: 1` box (see "Engine notes").

## Engine notes

- **Long text:** truncate it, don't let it be cut at the edge. A file name, a song title or a
  subject in a row: `whiteSpace: 'nowrap', textOverflow: 'ellipsis'` inside a `flex: 1` (or
  `minWidth: 0`) box. A preview or a description: `numberOfLines: 2` (the last line ends in "…").
  Text that has a fixed height and `textOverflow: 'ellipsis'` keeps the lines that fit. The cut
  never splits a ligature, a mark or an emoji sequence, and the "…" goes where the text ends: on the
  left in Arabic and Hebrew (screenshots: `engine-ellipsis-*.png`).
- **Hairlines:** a separator that belongs to a box is a border of that box:
  `borderBottomWidth: 1, borderBottomColor: t.separator` (or `borderTop…`, `borderStart…`/`borderEnd…`,
  which follow RTL). Remember that a border is inside the box: add 1 px to a fixed height to keep the
  content where it was. `Hairline` (an absolute 1 px view) is still the tool for a line inset from
  the edges or over something else.
- **Corners:** `borderTopLeftRadius`… or the logical `borderTopStartRadius`… for shapes rounded on one
  side (a segmented control's ends, a bubble).
- **Logical edges:** `marginInlineStart`/`End`, `paddingInlineStart`/`End` and `insetInlineStart`/`End`
  follow the node's direction, so `[direction() === 'rtl' ? 'right' : 'left']` is no longer needed
  (`left`/`right` and `margin*Left`/`Right` stay physical, as in CSS).
- **Scale and rotate:** `transform: [{ scale: pressed ? 0.96 : 1 }]` for a press effect,
  `transform: 'rotate(…deg)'` for a spinner; layout doesn't change and clicks follow what is painted.
  lord-server paints the subtree once into a cached raster and composites it, so animating the scale
  is cheap (the Dock's minimize effect does it on a whole window: `engine-dock-minimize.png`).
- **`flex: 0`** is React Native's: the box keeps its `width`/`height` and doesn't grow or shrink (it
  used to mean a zero basis, which collapsed a box with a `width`). `flex: 1` and a `width` on the same
  box still mean "grow from 0" (the `width` is ignored): pass one or the other.

## Pending (engine)

- No vector icon set: icons are font glyphs (see above).
