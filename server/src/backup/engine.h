/* engine.h — the backup engine (Backups app, docs/SYSTEM.md).
 *
 * Our own code, no rsync: a snapshot is a complete tree of the home folder in
 *   <dest>/LordOS-Backups/<host>-<user>/<YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS>/
 * Files that did not change (same size, modification time and mode as in the previous snapshot)
 * are hard links to the previous one: every snapshot looks complete but only takes the space of
 * what changed. While copying, the tree lives in .inprogress-<stamp>; it is renamed at the end
 * (atomic). An interrupted run is resumed: the next one uses that partial tree as another link
 * source and then deletes it.
 *
 * This file knows nothing about threads or JS (backup.c uses it, tests/backup_test.c tests it). */
