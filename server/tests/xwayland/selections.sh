# selections.sh — clipboard/primary checks for X11 apps, run inside a LordOS session on a test VM
# (DISPLAY and WAYLAND_DISPLAY of the session; needs xclip, wl-clipboard, xterm and
# build/clip-offers). See docs/WAYLAND.md, "X11 apps (Xwayland)", and docs/PRIVACY.md.

#
# 1. An X11 app's copy (CLIPBOARD and PRIMARY) reaches Wayland apps.
# 2. Offers are bound to their selection: a Wayland app can't read later copies through an old offer.
# 3. A Wayland copy is not readable by a background X11 app (no X window has the keyboard), nor by
#    another X11 client while an X window has it (only the focused window's client may paste).
